1 x 18650 battery holder for use with correct 18650 battery terminals.
1 x Housing Case.
1 x Housing Back Cover
3 x Housing Buttons
2 x Housing Screen Mount

also required
6 x M3 4mm brass heat inserts to press into the holes for the bolts.
4 x M3 10mm bolts (to secure the back cover)
2 x M3 8mm bolts (to secure the screen to the housing)

The housing and back cover I printed with cura and the fuzzy skin option that makes the sides match the front when removed from my pei bed.
If printing on glass I would not use fuzzy skin then the sides and front would be smooth all over
